	<p>The first thing you do is search the NASA image library by entering one or more 
	terms. Although there are a number of space related terms, searching on other terms, 
	like places on Earth and famous people, also yields good results. The results are
	currently limited to about 20 per page.</p>
	<p>After you've selected an image, you describe what you want to do with it. This is
	called a prompt. For example, you could say "Render this as a pastel drawing." Or
	you could try "Turn the astronaut into a cat." The possibilities are endless.</p>
	<p>For this, you'll need a Stable Diffusion API key. Don't worry -- it doesn't
	require a credit card and you get a generous amount of free usage. You can
	get one by logging into <a href="https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/home">Dream Studio</a>.
	Dream Studio is pretty cool, but does it offer the ability to search for NASA 
	images? No, it does not.</p>
	<p>After the app sends the image back, you can easily resubmit it with more 
	prompts if you wish to. Who knows where you'll end up?</p>
