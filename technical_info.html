  <p>This application uses an HTML/Javascript front end that communicates with the NASA 
  image library via the NASA APIs and also communicates with a Python Flask back end 
  hosted on a GCP Ubuntu Linux VM. The Flask back end communicates with the Stable 
  Diffusion API. At this point, we're not aware of any APIs that allow a web-based client
  to communicate directly with the Stable Diffusion API, so it had to work like this.  
  </p>
  <p>
  The Flask back end is running on port 5000, so a rule had to be added for the firewall to 
  accept tcp traffic on port 5000. We also start it with this command "flask run --host=0.0.0.0" 
  to make it visible. Using the "nohup" option can help it run in the background if the user 
  gets logged off. Since the information that's getting sent to the server contains a key,
  we're using POST rather than GET. (We should also have a certificate installed and be
  sending it securely, but this was a weekend.)
